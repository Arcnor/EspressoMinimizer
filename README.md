# Readme

## Currently working on
* Single output version of the espresso algorithm.
* During development of this phase, some components are already being prepared for the multiple output version.

## Done so far
* Classes (use Cover and Cube) to model boolean functions. Check test cases for usage.
* Simplify minimization algorithm for single output boolean functions. It's been tested on several cases and it seems to work. Note that (just like espresso) this is a fast heuristic minimizer.
